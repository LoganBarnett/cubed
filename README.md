What in the world is this? Cubed is a library for dealing with voxels in Unity.

What are voxels? Voxels are cubes used to make objects in 3 dimensional space much in the way that pixels can be used to make 2 dimensional images. Think Minecraft for a real world example.

How do I use it? 
Installation:
# Get the library from here or the Asset Store (coming soon!) 
# Create a game object * Add the CubedObject behaviour to the game object 
# Create Cube Definitions in the inspector and assign materials to sides (this is your palette)
# Click Pack Textures in the inspector for the CubedObject
# Give the CubedObject some data (or use the editor coming soon) 
# Click Bake Cubes in the inspector for the CubedObject

Coming soon!
* Collisions
* Adding and Removing Cubes
* Editor in Unity
